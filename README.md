# How to run it
<ol>
  <li>Download the latest version of Cmake stable (Last Release from the official site)</li>
https://cmake.org/download/

<li>Source folder: where are the code sources (.cpp and .h). Destination folder: where you want the project to be created</li>

<li>Configure (if it doesn't find QtMultimedia and QtWidgest, add them manually by clicking on the 3 dots)</li>
</ol>
N.B. The Qt library needs to be installed on the machine, otherwise it doesn't know where to get it. Dowload it from the official site

https://www.qt.io/download
<ol start=4>
  <li>Generate</li>
</ol>
N.B. After doing Generate, both the sources and the destination must NOT change path in the folders and you must NOT change the names of the folders or the project, otherwise nothing works anymore

In the destination folder click on the project created with the chosen IDE
